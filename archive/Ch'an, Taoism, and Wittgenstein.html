<h4 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION </font></h4>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin with I am quite aware that any 
attempt to deal with a topic such as &quot;Ch'an (Zen), Taoism, and Wittgenstein&quot; 
would have to face certain problems, risks, and criticisms, Some, for instance, would 
object on a priori grounds that the attempt made here is not scholarly nor fruitful, that 
it is a waste of time, and that it is philosophically unjustifiable to discourse on this 
type of topic. This is because involved in this type of topic are conceptual systems, 
philosophies, cultures, values, goals, and methodologies that are so different that they 
cannot be accurately understood in their own terms due to misinterpretation and 
distortion. Perhaps in cases in which careful and painstaking scholarly work is lacking or 
is not consistently carried out, this objection would be valid and it should be taken 
seriously as a healthy reminder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is fair and necessary to 
point out that my attempt to deal with this type of topic does constitute a 
philosophically legitimate, though not an entirely new venture. For, recent studies, 
discussions, and publications have shown that there are some significant parallels or 
resemblances not only between Western and Eastern philosophies in general as Archie J. 
Baum,<a name="[1]" href="#1">[1]</a> Frederick C. Copleston,<a name="[2]" href="#2">[2]</a> 
Kwee Swan Liat,<a name="[3]" href="#3">[3]</a> Paul Masson-Oursel,<a name="[4]" href="#4">[4]</a> 
Hajime Nakamura,<a name="[5]" href="#5">[5]</a> Troy Wilson Organ,<a name="[6]" href="#6">[6]</a> 
John C. Plott,<a name="[7]" href="#7">[7]</a> P. T. Raju,<a name="[8]" href="#8">[8]</a> 
and Ben-Ami Scharfstein,<a name="[9]" href="#9">[9]</a> to name a few, have admirably 
demonstrated. But there are also some interesting parallels between Chinese philosophy, 
particularly between the Ch'an School of Chinese Buddhism and the philosophy of Taoism 
espoused by Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, and the philosophy of the early and later Wittgenstein 
as Dennis Ahern,<a name="[10]" href="#10">[10]</a> Arthur Danto,<a name="[11]" href="#11">[11]</a> 
Russell Goodman,<a name="[12]" href="#12">[12]</a> Ben-Ami Scharfstein,<a name="[13]"
href="#13">[13]</a> and Lik Kuen Tong,<a name="[14]" href="#14">[14]</a> to name a few, 
have ably shown.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that I have conveyed the 
impression that what I want to say on this topic is an outgrowth of and elaboration upon 
the relevant contributions of these and other scholars. Accordingly, I would like to make 
it my aim to </font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.128 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">discuss how we can interrelate the Ch'an School, 
philosophic Taoism, and Wittgenstein in terms of their major tenets so that the question 
of their compatibility or incompatibility can be addressed and resolved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to achieve this aim, I will 
attempt to first discuss some connecting links between the Ch'an School (recognized by 
some to have been originated by Bodhidharma and developed more significantly by Hui-neng, 
Shen-hsiu, and others) and philosophic Taoism (derived from Lao Tzu and developed by 
Chuang Tzu). Then I will present a similar discussion of some connecting links between 
Ch'an and Taoism combined, and Wittgenstein- especially the early and later Wittgenstein. 
I will conclude by using the discussion on connecting links to deal with the question as 
to whether or not Ch'an and Taoism can be philosophically compatible with Wittgenstein and 
to what extent.</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<h4 align="center"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CH'AN AND 
TAOISM </font></strong></h4>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In trying to discuss some connecting 
links between Ch'an and Taoism, I wish to make clear that it is not my purpose to make 
into an issue the question as to whether the Ch'an School of Chinese Buddhism was 
originated by the Indian Buddhist Bodhidharma or by somebody else such as Tao-seng (as the 
distinguished scholar Hu Shih had argued in 1932 in his informative and thorough article 
entitled &quot;Development of Zen Buddhism in China.&quot;<a name="[15]" href="#15">[15]</a>) 
Nor do I intend to make into an issue the question as to whether the Taoist philosophy 
that stems from Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu did have any decisive impact on the development of 
Ch'an, though there is some evidence that &quot;the philosophy of Ch'an (or Zen) Buddhism 
is remarkably similar to philosophic Taoism, and that at least some of its founders were 
quite familiar with the Chuang Tzu.&quot;<a name="[16]" href="#16">[16]</a> Rather I want 
to acknowledge the various contributions made by numerous Taoist philosophers and Ch'an 
masters to the development of Ch'an. And, for the sake of discussion, I want to 
concentrate on some positive factors shared by philosophic Taoism and the Ch'an School. 
Among some of the most significant of these are the following: (1) recognition of a 
reality immanent in everybody and in everything including the world of Nature, (2) 
acceptance and practice of the wordless doctrine according to which enlightenment or 
liberation is not founded on words, letters, rituals, and traditions, (3) emphasis on 
naturalness and spontaneity, and (4) maintenance of the harmony of opposites.<a
name="[17]" href="#17">[17]</a></font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.129 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us make these factors more 
explicit. From Lao Tzu's point of view, the immanent reality is no other than Tao, which 
can be understood in two important senses. In the absolute sense Tao is not a reality with 
describable features due to its simplicity, emptiness, and indeterminateness, which is 
somewhat analogous to an uncarved block. In the relative sense Tao is a describable 
reality by virtue of its creative and dynamic function considered as the source and 
sustainer of the universe.<a name="[18]" href="#18">[18]</a> In the absolute sense the 
intrinsic reality of Tao is necessarily beyond description, in which case we are compelled 
to exercise silence, or even better, to express our knowledge of Tao by refraining from 
using language to talk about Tao when we may happen to know Tao. As Lao Tzu paradoxically 
but tersely remarks, &quot;He who knows [the Tao] does not [care to] speak [about it];he 
who is [ever ready to speak about it does not know it.&quot;<a name="[19]" href="#19">[19]</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Ch'an standpoint, what is 
called the immanent reality is part and parcel of everyone and everything<a name="[20]"
href="#20">[20]</a> and is disclosed through personal awakening, which is referred to as 
the experience of enlightenment (wu). However, without limiting itself to Taoism, the 
Ch'an School recognizes that such an immanent reality is no other than the realization of 
Buddha nature or having no mind of one's own,<a name="[21]" href="#21">[21]</a> which is 
an undifferentiated continuum due to forgetting of all distinctions<a name="[22]"
href="#22">[22]</a> but not an underlying substance with a Cartesian center of its own.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enlightenment experience referred 
to can come about in one of two ways. According to the Northern School of Ch'an led by 
Shen-hsiu (600-706),<a name="[23]" href="#23">[23]</a> the personal realization is a 
matter of gradual enlightenment because one has to distinguish the unenlightened part from 
the enlightened part of the mind and it takes time for the mind to be enlightened. But 
according to the Southern School led by Hui-neng (638-713),<a name="[24]" href="#24">[24]</a> 
personal awakening is a type of transforming and revolutionary experience that can occur 
suddenly with unexpected intensity. For the Southern School of Hui-neng, it is misleading 
to speak of the unenlightened and enlightened parts of the mind as if they were separated 
out from moment to moment. Instead all of these belong to one mind and are 
indistinguishable when the moment of direct intuition and personal enlightenment comes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the second factor, we 
can see that both the Ch'an School and Taoism do reject the descriptive and explanatory 
uses of language to deal with the truth of personal enlightenment.<a name="[25]"
href="#25">[25]</a> In general this rejection</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.130 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">represents a denial of the applicability and validity of 
what is called the theory of names, which calls for a one-to-one correspondence between 
names and referents. In the case of the Ch'an School, any effort to express or describe 
the content of the enlightenment experience of wu is rejected because the direct 
realization of wu is not readily distinguishable from the emptiness or suchness of things 
as they are. That the realization and attainment of wu is not amenable to semantic and 
syntactical manipulations is reflected in the Ch'an conviction that the truth of 
enlightenment is &quot;not expressed in words or written in letters&quot;<a name="[26]"
href="#26">[26]</a> but is directly intuited and experienced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Taoist perspective, any 
attempt to use written or spoken words to talk about Tao, especially in the absolute 
sense, is also rejected on the grounds of indescribability or unnameability and ignorance 
of the nature of Tao. As Lao Tzu observes, </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Tao that can be expressed (named)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not the Absolute Tao.<br>
      The names that can be spoken<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are not Absolute Names.<a name="[27]" href="#27">[27]</a> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Here the Taoist rejection or caution is predicated on two 
supporting arguments. The first argument proceeds from the premise that the absolute Tao 
is such that its simplicity, emptiness, and indeterminateness would logically preclude the 
possibility of assigning to the absolute Tao any describable attributes or nameable 
features. Accordingly, since Tao, absolutely considered, is simple and devoid, like a 
vacuum, of any determinate qualities, the absolute Tao is not a nameable or describable 
referent. This implies that the absolute Tao by its very nature can only be properly 
understood by overcoming or transcending the conventions of language and the tendency to 
resort to silence as a form of nonverbal communication. To this effect, Chuang Tzu 
cautions as follow: </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Were language adequate, it would take but a day fully to 
    set forth Tao.<br>
    Not being adequate, it takes that time to explain material existences. <br>
    Tao is something beyond material existences. <br>
    It cannot be conveyed either by words or by silence.<a name="[28]" href="#28">[28]</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.131 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other supporting argument is that 
&quot;knowing&quot; the absolute Tao is neither a matter of having knowledge in the 
conventional sense nor a matter of having no-knowledge.<a name="[29]" href="#29">[29]</a> 
This is because the state of knowledge in the conventional sense presupposes a 
subject-object distinction, which is extrinsic to the absolute Tao. And because the state 
of having no knowledge is indicative of blind ignorance or illusory consciousness, which 
hampers any attempt to know the absolute Tao and to capitalize on its creative efficacy 
(te). Rather knowing the absolute Tao involves the discarding of knowledge by forgetting 
all distinctions.<a name="[30]" href="#30">[30]</a> This move results in the 
non-epistemological state of having no-knowledge, which comes after the stage of having 
knowledge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implicit in this rejection of language 
and knowledge in the conventional sense are two outstanding pragmatic strategies 
characteristic of the practice of the Ch'an School and Taoism. One of these is the 
tactical application of the iconoclastic attitude to challenge and loosen the grip of. 
conventions in society. The other is the catalytic use of silence to break up the 
dichotomizing and restrictive tendency of conventional knowledge and language. The 
iconoclastic attitude stems from the conviction that written and spoken words, because 
they are an integral part of the rules and conventions of language, tend to reify and 
obscure the immediate quality of the enlightenment experience. The catalytic use of 
silence is not so much to communicate non-verbally as it is to overcome or transcend 
spontaneously and unconditionally the conceptual constraints<a name="[31]" href="#31">[31]</a> 
imposed by language, knowledge, and thinking in the conventional sense, whether or not we 
are made aware of the limitations and inadequacies of our language, knowledge, and 
thinking.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two pragmatic strategies give 
rise to the third and fourth factors characteristic of the practice of Ch'an and Taoism. 
Both regard the quest for enlightenment as not requiring the performance of any special or 
super-mundane activities in addition to the daily activities or tasks that people perform 
naturally and spontaneously. This means that the Ch'an and Taoist aspirants do not opt for 
enlightenment as if it were a state external to, or separate from all other activities of 
everyday life or the mundane world including the world of Nature. Rather they try to 
attain enlightenment through a tactical, undistracted, and alert performance of 
diversified but harmonized activities of everyday life familiar to everybody, This also 
means that the Ch'an and Taoist aspirants are able to perform their usual tasks</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.132 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">with strategic advantage because they are conceptually 
liberated from external constraints and the yoke of conventions. Consequently, as 
conceptually liberated individuals, they are able to effectively work their way through 
the conventions of society instead of being used by them.<a name="[32]" href="#32">[32]</a> 
From the Ch'an perspective such a manner of operating is indicative of an individual who 
is capable of going through moments of enlightened living while he is actively involved in 
activities such as eating, washing dishes, cutting grass, painting a house, chopping wood, 
etc. But from the Taoist perspective such a mode of living is characteristic of an 
individual who operates through the superior Way of non-action (wu-wei),<a name="[33]"
href="#33">[33]</a> which must be regarded as the path of least interference, but not as 
the static state of' mere passiveness or inactivity. Moreover, such an individual, when he 
learns to let himself go or leave his mind alone, is capable of following the superior Way 
of non-interfering action because he acts through and with the creative and virtuous power 
of te<a name="[34]" href="#34">[34]</a> whose practical efficacy<a name="[35]" href="#35">[35]</a> 
is exemplified by his natural and spontaneous action. That superior and effective 
performance can be attributed to the practical efficacy or agency of te is attested to by 
Lao Tzu when he observes as follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Superior te is not te,<br>
      and thus has te.<br>
      Inferior te does not let go of te,<br>
      and thus is not te.<br>
      Superior te is non-active [wu wei] and aimless.<br>
      Inferior te is active and has an aim.<a name="[36]" href="#36">[36]</a> </font></p>
      <p>¡@</p>

<h4 align="center"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CH'AN, 
TAOISM, AND WITTGENSTEIN </font></strong></h4>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given these factors considered as 
possible links that connect Ch'an and Taoism, let us determine and discuss whether and how 
any of these and other possible links can relate Ch'an and Taoism to Wittgenstein.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we do this, it is necessary to 
have a clear overview of the entire philosophy of Wittgenstein so that we can see clearly 
which aspects of Wittgenstein's philosophy can be connected with Ch'an and Taoism. As it 
is customarily done, the entire philosophy of Wittgenstein is divided into four main 
periods, which are referred to as (1) the early Wittgenstein, (2) the middle Wittgenstein, 
(3) the later Wittgenstein, and (4) the mature Wittgenstein .</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.133</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the philosophy of the early 
Wittgenstein set forth in the Tractatus, the main concern is the development of a logic of 
description that governs the describable states of affairs. The fundamental underpinnings 
of the logic of description are the doctrine of logical atomism and the doctrine of 
logical independence of elementary propositions. According to the first doctrine, factual 
descriptions of particular states of affairs or atomic facts in the world are possible by 
means of elementary propositions in such a way that the latter are logical pictures of the 
former. According to the second doctrine, in order for these elementary propositions to be 
descriptive of corresponding unique factual states of affairs, these elementary 
propositions must have definite or determinate propositional sense. Otherwise, they would 
be so unavoidably ambiguous that they would be descriptive of no particular state of 
affairs-actual or possible. And in order for these elementary propositions to have 
determinate sense, their constituents must be simple names that stand for simple objects 
whose configurations can give rise to the structure of depictable states of affairs. On 
the basis of the logic of description, the Tractatus recommends that when we are dealing 
with states of affairs that are not describable or that are not susceptible to linguistic 
articulation, we are better off if we exercise silence. As Wittgenstein says in the 
concluding proposition of his Tractatus: &quot;What we cannot speak about we must pass 
over in silence.&quot;<a name="[37]" href="#37">[37]</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the philosophy of the middle 
Wittgenstein set forth in Philosophical Remarks and Philosophical Grammar, the main 
concern is to preserve the contextual setting for the proper understanding of propositions 
that are already accepted or held to be true. This is done by placing propositions within 
a particular conceptual system in which they first arise and make sense. Consequently we 
cannot indiscriminately confuse propositions that may be true within a particular 
conceptual system with those that may be true in another conceptual system. This implies 
that the truth or falsity of propositions is relative to the conceptual system to which 
they belong and is contingent on the categories and forms of life operative within such 
conceptual systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the philosophy of the later 
Wittgenstein set forth in Philosophical Investigations and Blue and Brown Books, the main 
concern is to remind us of, and make us take seriously the many different but legitimate 
uses of language in its natural every day setting. Here language is no longer restricted</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.134 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">to the way we describe the world. Rather the focus of 
attention is on the actual and possible uses in which people employ language in connection 
with their accepted and practiced forms of life. This means that uses of language do 
encompass people's values, lifestyles, natural histories, and traditions in which they 
live, work, study, worship, communicate, and perform many other activities. The upshot of 
all this is that whatever we mean or intend to say is disclosed by the particular context 
in which we use language analogous to the way we play games.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the philosophy of the mature 
Wittgenstein set forth in On Certainty, the main concern is to show that the 
non-epistemological certainty of common-sense propositions lies not in philosophical 
justification but in following with regularity an established practice. Unlike the British 
philosopher G. E. Moore who attempted to offer a justification or verification for our 
acceptance of common-sense propositions, the mature Wittgenstein argues that such 
propositions are not strictly {empirical} propositions that require justification or 
verification. For, the certainty of common-sense propositions is not based on the 
elimination of doubt by appealing to some solid epistemological foundation. Rather, 
common-sense propositions acquire their certainty from the everyday practice carried out 
regularly by people when they go through their daily routines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given our discussion on Ch'an and 
Taoism and given our presentation of the entire philosophy of Wittgenstein, we can relate 
Ch'an and Taoism to Wittgenstein by concentrating on the following connecting links: (1) 
forms of life and uses of language;(2) everyday life and practical activities; (3) 
particularity and complementarity; (4) problems and solutions; (5) the inexpressible and 
resort to silence;and (6) private language and private sense.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first link we find that the 
Ch'an quest for the enlightenment experience of wu and the Taoist search for the path of 
active non-interfering action presuppose what the later Wittgenstein calls forms of life. 
For the later Wittgenstein, these forms of life must be accepted as the givens.<a
name="[38]" href="#38">[38]</a> Such givens not only project new ways of living and new 
ways of seeing and looking at the world, but they also give rise to a new language and new 
uses of language. Since forms of life can become an important part of understanding the 
different uses into which language is put, it is consistent with the approach of the later 
Wittgenstein to infer that the forms of life pursued or cultivated by Ch'an and Taoism can 
provide the proper contexts or stage</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.135 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">settings for understanding the particular uses of language 
made by practitioners of Ch'an and Taoism. We can now see that the significance of this 
first link lies in the twofold flexibility of the later Wittgenstein. On the one hand, the 
later Wittgenstein (as well as the middle Wittgenstein) would accept as givens the Ch'an 
and Taoist forms of life with their systems of communication. On the other hand, the later 
Wittgenstein would also recognize that there are many different uses and strategies that 
can be pragmatically advantageous to the goals and needs of the Ch'an and Taoist 
practitioners.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second link we find that the 
recognition of everyday life and practical activities is common to Ch'an, Taoism and the 
later and mature Wittgenstein. However, this common recognition arises from different but 
not mutually exclusive considerations. On the one hand, the later and mature 
Wittgenstein's recognition stems from the common-sense observation that in everyday life 
and practical activities we are provided with concrete contexts for publicly teachable and 
learnable uses of language that can become part of the regular practice of accepted 
conventions. But Ch'an and Taoist recognition arises from the conviction that while the 
quest for wu or Tao can be effectively conducted in a practical manner within the confines 
of everyday life, we should be alerted that the accepted conventions can only be followed 
to the extent that doing so does not hinder or jeopardize the natural and spontaneous 
performance of daily tasks. In other words, the later Wittgenstein holds that the 
consistent following of accepted conventions can display rule-governed behavior and the 
mature Wittgenstein holds that the regular practice of numerous daily-life activities can 
give ordinary certainty to common-sense propositions. But Ch'an and Taoism would require 
that it is no necessary to carry out either practice to the point where such practice 
would rule out unconventional and iconoclastic but conceivable strategies needed for the 
language-game of attaining the wu experience or of identifying with Tao.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is significant about this link is 
that it points to two ways of dealing with scepticism. For the later and mature 
Wittgenstein, the nonepistemological certainty displayed by consistent following of 
accepted conventions shows that the sceptic's position can't be expressed and communicated 
without being meaningless and self-defeating, since it presupposes the common use of a 
public language whose rules are socially binding. But for Ch'an and Taoism, a certain 
degree of pragmatic iconoclasm has to be</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.136 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">exercised in order not to allow such conventions and the 
sceptic's pronouncements on doubt to interfere with the spontaneous and creative 
performance of everyday-life activities that are conducive to personal enlightenment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the third link we find that Ch'an 
and Taoism are in agreement with the later Wittgenstein's injunction against the tendency 
to generalize and to reify universals without paying attention to particular cases with 
their individuating features.<a name="[39]" href="#39">[39]</a> Like the iconoclastic 
Ch'an and Taoist masters who would rather prefer the concrete experience of enlightenment 
or unverbalized identification with Tao instead of their abstract representation, the 
later Wittgenstein proceeds by giving reminders and by citing examples when faced with a 
philosophical problem. Implicit in this link is a joint effort by Ch'an, Taoism, and the 
later Wittgenstein to reject the Platonic view of universals or theory of forms in favor 
of fusing and concretizing universals with particulars depending on .the specific content 
of use. For Ch'an and Taoism, although the particulars of experience can become pragmatic 
exigencies for universals, the particulars themselves can be related to and harmonized 
with each other. This is because the particulars can function as complements of each other 
even though they may be different. However, for the later Wittgenstein, what is 
illuminating about the particulars of experience is that although they may possess 
different features, two or more of these particulars can have overlapping similarities 
which would give rise to family resemblances<a name="[40]" href="#40">[40]</a> without 
presupposing some metaphysical essence that must be common to all of them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fourth link we find that with 
this inheritance of the notion of &quot;the indubitable Tao&quot;, the Ch'an School, 
particularly Hui-neng's Southern School which favors sudden enlightenment, can be related 
to the early and later Wittgenstein. This can be seen in the way problems of life and 
problems f philosophy are treated. From the perspective of sudden enlightenment held by 
the Ch'an Southern School, problems of life are solved not when the enlightened person 
comes up with some definitive solution for his alleged problem. Rather his alleged problem 
is solved in the sense that it ceases to be a problem when its problematic content 
suddenly disappears due to the sudden change in his way of viewing the world brought about 
by his sudden enlightenment.<a name="[41]" href="#41">[41]</a> This sudden disappearance 
of the enlightened person's alleged problem is often compared by Ch'an masters to the 
falling out of the bottom of a tub filled with a certain content (water).<a name="[42]"
href="#42">[42]</a> The tub's</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.137 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">content can suddenly disappear from one's view at the 
moment when the bottom of the tub suddenly falls out, resulting in a complete loss of its 
content, which is similar to the dissolution of the alleged problem in a way therapeutic 
to the enlightened person.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the Ch'an masters, the early and 
later Wittgenstein treats problems of life and philosophy by urging us to acquire a 
vantage point from which the alleged problems are no longer seen as problems.<a
name="[43]" href="#43">[43]</a> For the early Wittgenstein, what we need to do about 
problems of life is not to opt for some sure-fire panacea, since none may be forthcoming. 
Rather what we need to do is to see clearly that a possible way out is to begin by 
vanishing an alleged problem for which no laboriously contrived solution would be needed 
once its content falls out of view as Ch'an masters would say. For the later Wittgenstein, 
philosophical problems are solved not by coming up with new or special information. Rather 
they are dissolved by having a clear understanding of the inner workings of the language 
used and by arranging the body of information and knowledge accessible to us in different 
patterns viewed from new perspectives. What is significant about this approach to problems 
of life and problems of philosophy is that the previously tormented mind of the 
philosopher or enlightened person, when the problems are dissolved, is eventually brought 
to a peaceful state, which seems to be psychologically equivalent to the state of mind 
characteristic of the enlightenment experience of wu or the identification with the Way of 
wu-wei.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fifth link we find that such 
advocates of Ch'an as Hui-neng and such exponents of Taoist philosophy as Lao Tzu and 
Chuang Tzu are in agreement with the early Wittgenstein that there are realities that 
cannot be expressed or described in terms of written and spoken words or by language in 
general. The suggested strategy or advice from Ch'an, Taoism, and the early Wittgenstein 
can be stated in this way. If there is a linguistically inexpressible or indescribable 
reality, the proper course of action is to practice silence or resort to some form of 
&quot;wordless faith.&quot;<a name="[44]" href="#44">[44]</a> For Ch'an such a reality is 
revealed through the enlightenment' experience of wu. For Taoism such a reality is 
manifested through the creative and dynamic agency of Tao when the Way of non-action 
(wu-wei) is followed. And for the early Wittgenstein, such a reality is referred to as 
&quot;the mystical.&quot;<a name="[45]" href="#45">[45]</a> Three examples of the mystical 
are (1) the fact that the world does exist,<a name="[46]" href="#46">[46]</a> (2) feeling 
the world as a limited whole,<a name="[47]" href="#47">[47]</a> and (3) the things that 
show themselves.<a name="[48]" href="#48">[48]</a> What Ch'an and</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.138 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Taoism recognize as the inexpressible seems to be 
equivalent to the early Wittgenstein's third category of the mystical. This seems to be 
the case because in both the enlightenment experience of wu and the identification with 
the Way of wu-wei, the immanent reality discloses itself without the necessity for 
linguistic articulation or logical description.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when the early Wittgenstein 
concludes that &quot;what we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence,<a
name="[49]" href="#49">[49]</a> we have to be clear about what this silence means and why 
it is recommended, especially With respect to Ch'an and Taoism. How shall we interpret 
this silence for the early Wittgenstein and does this silence function in a way equivalent 
or complementary to the way silence functions for Ch'an and Taoism? We can interpret the 
recommended silence as a state due to a speech defect, due to an uncoerced willingness not 
to speak, due to a temporary physical and mental exhaustion, due to a refusal to speak 
while being submitted to external pressures, due to a personal decision to withhold 
information, or due to one's decision to exercise one's constitutional right to remain 
silent. Judging from his aforementioned remarks, the early Wittgenstein does not seem to 
have in mind any of these meanings for the recommended silence. Instead by silence the 
early Wittgenstein seems to mean a logically necessary curtailment of the descriptive use 
of language when the limits of' logical description are reached, since descriptive 
propositions can only have definite sense within such limits. This means that even the 
interpretation of silence as a non-verbal mode of communication is also ruled out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given this notion of` silence, we would 
like to know whether it functions in a way that is equivalent or complementary to the way 
silence functions for Ch'an and Taoism. Since, as we pointed out earlier, both Ch'an and 
Taoism have rejected the theory of names and description, which is consequential to the 
silence recommended by the early Wittgenstein, and since both Ch'an and Taoism are 
committed to a concrete cultivation of a direct unmediated experience through natural and 
spontaneous actions, we can infer that silence for the Ch'an and Taoist practitioners 
seems to function as a pedagogical device that does nor presuppose a descriptive language 
whose limits precondition the necessity for silence.<a name="[50]" href="#50">[50]</a> 
Whereas the practice of silence for Ch'an and Taoism can be done spontaneously without the 
need to overcome the limits of logical description, the practice of silence for the early 
Wittgenstein is an inevitable consequence of being</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.139 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">made aware of the limits of logical description. Although 
these two ways of practicing silence are not functionally equivalent, they seem to be 
complementary. On the one hand, the Ch'an and Taoist use of silence is intended to 
transcend the dichotomy between communication by words and communication by silence. And 
on the other hand, the early Wittgenstein's use of silence is intended to prevent us from 
transgressing the limits of logical description, beyond which propositional sense is 
inexpressible but at which the meaning and value of the mystical can be shown though it 
cannot be said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the sixth link we find something 
remarkable about the way Ch'an and Taoism are related to the early and later Wittgenstein. 
By virtue of the Ch'an and Taoist rejection of the theory of names and description and by 
virtue of the Ch'an and Taoist spontaneous and unconditional 'use of silence, the 
possibility of a private language is eliminated, which the later Wittgenstein also rejects 
but for different reasons. For the later Wittgenstein,<a name="[51]" href="#51">[51]</a> 
it is not logically possible to have a private language because it is difficult if not 
impossible to have reliable and independent criteria for the determination and 
verification of the sense and truth of strictly private claims. Moreover, since such 
criteria are lacking or cannot be obtained, there would be no significant difference 
between current and incorrect understanding of the use of language. Consequently, the 
notion of following rules privately without external checking would be contradictory and 
would have no intelligible sense.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is important about the later 
Wittgenstein's private-language argument is that he does not deny or downgrade the 
existence of any private entities or mental processes as is often thought by some. What 
the later Wittgenstein wants to expose is the logical difficulty or practical 
impossibility of trying to learn privately and consistently from one's own case the sense 
and truth of descriptive propositions on the basis of the name-object model with the 
alleged private rules and private understanding. On this point Ch'an and Taoist 
practitioners, due to their pragmatic use of conventions, would agree with the later 
Wittgenstein that no intelligible and consistent sense can be given to our descriptive 
propositions on a strictly private basis, This implies that the only consistent and 
checkable way for referring to our private sensations and other mental processes is to use 
with regularity a publicly learnable and teachable language. However, Ch'an and Taoist 
practitioners wouldn't rely solely on the public use of language because their</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.140 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">life activities and other preoccupations can best be 
executed with unconventional and iconoclastic tactics, including the strategic use of 
silence for overcoming the constraints imposed by the public use of language.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here lies one significant difference 
between the later Wittgenstein and Ch'an and Taoist practitioners. While the former has a 
great respect for the ordinary or familiar uses of language based on public criteria and 
social conventions, the latter intend to diffuse or minimize the limiting influence of 
such criteria and conventions should they become barriers against spontaneous action for 
personal enlightenment. </font></p>

<h4 align="center"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
COMPATIBILITY OR INCOMPATIBILITY OF<br>
CH'AN AND TAOISM WITH WITTGENSTEIN </font></strong></h4>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the preceding discussion I 
would like to address and resolve the compatibility/incompatibility question. Although 
some of the connecting links discussed are sometimes not clear-cut and are somewhat 
artificial, it is fair to say that the question of the compatibility of Ch'an and Taoism 
with Wittgenstein can be assessed in terms of those links that have been effectively 
demonstrated. in looking at the six links discussed, I think that links 2, 3,4, and 5 seem 
to provide more defensible grounds for compatibility than links 1 and 6 would provide. It 
is clear from the discussion of links 2 and 3 that Ch'an and Taoism are compatible with 
Wittgenstein, since they all emphasize the importance of everyday life,practical 
activities, and particular cases. However, it is clear from the discussion of the fourth 
link that Ch'an, rather than Taoism, is compatible with Wittgenstein, since their 
approaches approaches to problems of life and philosophy are based on the view that such 
problems can be likened to diseases and their solutions can be regarded as possible 
therapies,<a name="[52]" href="#52">[52]</a> resulting in having peace of mind and 
experience of harmony. The importance of this link is that it shows that although problems 
of life are central to Ch'an and problems of philosophy are central to Wittgenstein, the 
result for the problem solver in both preoccupations seems to be a form of personal 
liberation from an inability to see the world clearly as it is without mental 
entanglements and conceptual confusions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The discussion of the fifth link has 
shown that Ch'an and Taoism are compatible with the early Wittgenstein, since silence is 
used or recommended</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.141 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">by all three to deal with the inexpressible. However, what 
may still be unclear is whether Ch'an, Taoism, and the early Wittgenstein would recognize 
that silence is not only a necessary consequence of being exposed to the limits of 
language, but is also a pre-logical and non-linguistic precondition for using language and 
seeing the world aright. From the perspective of Ch'an and Taoism, the answer is 
affirmative. From the perspective of the early Wittgenstein, the answer tends to be 
understandably negative, given the priority of the requirements (demand for simple objects 
and demand for independent elementary propositions composed of simple names for such 
objects) for the logic of description. Consequently the compatibility on this link is only 
partial, since the early Wittgenstein seems to assign to silence the role of a logical 
indicator that signals when the limits of language are reached, while for Ch'an and 
Taoism, silence functions as an ontological presupposition for the possibility of 
language, but not as the consequence dictated by the impossibility of speech or linguistic 
sayability at the limits of language. However, the later Wittgenstein is compatible with 
Ch'an and Taoism, since he would treat silence as part of the accepted forms of life 
discussed in the first link. For the later Wittgenstein, there is a certain degree of 
silence or &quot;wordless faith&quot; implicit in, or shown by the practice of every-day 
life. As Paul Engelmann observes, &quot;What Wittgenstein's life and work shows is the 
possibility of a new spiritual attitude. It is 'a new way of life' which he lived... 
.Wittgenstein's language is the language of wordless faith.&quot;<a name="[53]" href="#53">[53]</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is a sense in which both 
Ch'an and Taoism can be compatible with the later Wittgenstein as discussed in the sixth 
link, the compatibility based on the logical impossibility of a private language tends to 
be misleading and questionable. This is because what the later Wittgenstein's 
private-language argument does is to shift the locus of understanding and using language 
with consistent public sense from an exclusively private affair to an ongoing social 
practice of the community. There is no question that this shift to the public practice 
reinforces the hold of accepted conventions on practitioners. However, since the 
practitioners of Ch'an and Taoism would like to be conceptually liberated from such 
conventions even to the point of appearing tactfully unconventional, the degree of 
compatibility is greatly reduced. Such a situation can be prevented if the later 
Wittgenstein would allow the Ch'an and Taoist practitioners to make up their own rules</font></p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p>¡@</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">p.142 </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">as they move on in the game of attaining enlightenment or 
finding Tao.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this assume we can make some 
concluding remarks. Although there are some points of possible incompatibility if left 
unclarified and unqualified, it is reasonable to conclude that he connecting links that 
relate Ch'an and Taoism to Wittgenstein, especially the later Wittgenstein, do provide 
some acceptable and significant grounds for relative or qualified compatibility. However, 
the extend to which Ch'an, Taoism, and Wittgenstein are philosophically compatible depends 
on the specific aspects in which they can be related to each other. On the one hand, the 
Ch'an School and philosophic Taoism are compatible with the early and later Wittgenstein, 
but only to a limited degree. On the other hand, since it is not entirely unreasonable to 
say that the Ch'an School has successfully incorporated into its philosophic heritage some 
outstanding characteristics of Taoism such as naturalness, spontaneity, iconoclasm, and 
non-action, the Ch'an School seems to be relatively more compatible with Wittgenstein, 
particularly the later Wittgenstein than Taoism, considered by itself, seems to be. This 
is because the emphasis on accepted forms of life, everyday life, practical activities, 
particular cases, dissolution of problems of life and philosophy, and flexibility on 
silence, is more characteristic of Ch'an than Taoism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course the relative or qualified 
compatibility of Ch'an and Taoism with Wittgenstein is not an absolutely true claim but a 
fairly reasonable hypothesis that may be entertained for whatever merits and demerits. But 
since most of the connecting links discussed seem to relate to an acceptable degree Ch'an 
and Taoism to Wittgenstein and vice versa, it is significant to observe that the related 
aspects that Ch'an and Taoism share with Wittgenstein tend to show that they may not be as 
philosophically remote and incompatible as we may be led to believe without closer 
scrutiny.</font></p>
