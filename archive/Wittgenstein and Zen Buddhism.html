<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In recent years there have been 
  those who assert that the philosophy of Wittgenstein resembles Zen Buddhism 
  and those who deny it on the ground that any supposed resemblances are only 
  apparent. But, so far as I know, neither party has made any serious attempt 
  to substantiate his claim. Normally this is understandable because their main 
  purposes lie in a different directions. It is, for instance, quite common for 
  the latter merely to locate Wittgenstein in a different philosophical tradition 
  and pin a label such as Logical Positivism or Logical Empiricism on him. I think 
  the matter is much more complex than this or indeed than either party seems 
  to allow. I want to try to see to what extent either position can be supported. 
  Any errors and confusions of which I am guilty may perhaps stimulate someone 
  to give a more thorough treatment or to attempt further clarification by way 
  of correction. <A href="#1" name=[1]>[1]</A></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one of his  
  typical dissertations Wittgenstein himself pointed out that its spirit was different  
  from the mainstream of European and American civilization. <A href="#2" name=[2]>[2]</A> About this K.  
  T. Fann comments: &quot;It is not surprising that we should find striking resemblances  
  between Wittgenstein's methods and those of Zen Buddhism -- a philosophy from  
  a very different culture.&quot; <A href="#3" name=[3]>[3]</A> Because it is not relevant to his main purpose  
  Fann does not proceed to clarify or support his assertion about these resemblances.  
  He merely contents himself with one or two general remarks about the well-known  
  ability of Zen masters to show the nonsensical character of metaphysical questions  
  along with a remark about a resemblance between the enlightenment attributed  
  to the Buddha and the state of complete clarity for which Wittgenstein was striving.  
  This seems as good a starting point as any other, and I will begin negatively  
  by challenging some of the resemblances mentioned by Fann.</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the outset  
  one of his assertions must be rejected and another regarded as seriously misleading.  
  In the first place Zen is described as &quot;a philosophy from a very different  
  culture.&quot; That Zen is the product of a very different culture cannot be  
  disputed; but that it is a philosophy has to be denied, and Zennists have always  
  done so. Indeed Zen is a deliberate and clearheaded rejection of the propriety  
  of importing philosophizing of any kind into the types of situation where the  
  person is directly concerned with the attainment of the enlightenment and liberation  
  attributed to the Buddha. This may well give Zen a certain philosophical interest,  
  especially when some of the methods used by Zen</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">p. 472</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">masters have the purpose of helping 
  the individual to realize the absurdity of doing this. One may also, of course, 
  philosophize about the &quot;aim&quot; of Zen and its methods but as has often 
  been pointed out, this is not to practice it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Fann 
  speaks of Zen masters showing the nonsensical character of metaphysical questions. 
  This is true, but misleading. It might be interpreted as meaning, for example, 
  that Zen masters hold implicitly at least some general thesis about the nonsensicality 
  of such questions and assertions. But this is not so, either in Zen in particular 
  or in Buddhism in general. When the Buddha was asked the famous Four Questions 
  we are told that he refused to answer, saying that they were profitless because 
  they are irrelevant to the problem of freeing us from suffering and are unanswerable 
  or undecidable. By the latter he has to be taken as meaning just what he says 
  and exhorting us to leave what is undecidable as undecidable. By abstaining 
  from any kind of yes or no answer he takes the Middle Way or the freedom of 
  no position on such matters. The questions have been said to be like asking 
  whether the hair of a tortoise is smooth or hard; but whatever we may think 
  of this analogy, the error involved seems to be that of confusing the Transcendent 
  with what is empirical in the ordinary sense of the latter word. <A href="#4" name=[4]>[4]</A> Alternatively 
  it amounts to confusing what is beyond all conceptualization with what is conceptualized, 
  or confusing two different categories. Later in the Maadhyamika dialectic, there 
  is a systematic effort to show that if we abandon the Buddha's position on such 
  questions and relapse into dogmatism or giving a yes or a no answer, the result 
  is self-contradiction and nonsense. But the dialectic is an attempt to demonstrate 
  the absurdity of dogmatic attitudes to propositions rather than the absurdity 
  of the propositions themselves. There is nothing wrong in conceptualization, 
  the fault lies in us when we confuse it with what is beyond conceptualization 
  and take a dogmatic attitude about the truth of the consequences of our mistake 
  or about the falsity of someone else's. In Zen, where the chief concern is with 
  the practice of meditation, a Zen master may indeed show the nonsensical character 
  of metaphysical questions and assertions, but when doing so he speaks from the 
  position of the Buddha, with such points as those mentioned in mind, to those 
  who are actively and directly engaged in attaining enlightenment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless 
  there is a perfectly legitimate function for Buddhist metaphysics, although 
  it is subject to certain provisos. It must be constructed in such a way that 
  it is helpful in freeing us from attachment and, in accordance with the principles 
  of the nonsubstantiality of all things, their impermanence and conditionality. 
  In so helping us it will not and cannot describe or give us a picture of the 
  world as seen by a buddha, but it can point to the experience of a</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><A href="#[4]" name=4>4</A>. Cf. T. R. V. Murti, The Central

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">p. 473</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">buddha. Such schemes give us an 
  account in terms of basic constituents or the interrelatedness of things of 
  such a kind that it would be impossible or even conceptually absurd to be attached 
  to them. We are apt to become attached to our own pictures or constructions, 
  which we make from such accounts, and when this happens we are victims of illusion. 
  So we can say that any Buddhist metaphysic contains an inbuilt correction against 
  dogmatic attachment to it: like a kind of medicine that carries with it an antidote 
  against addiction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a conventional 
  point of view such a metaphysic may be regarded as true, and certainly every 
  effort will be made to provide something which can be so regarded. But this 
  kind of truth applies only to conceptual constructions, and its importance lies 
  in the fact that it enhances the scheme's utility for helping people. In short, 
  its function is basically therapeutic, and the motive involved is compassion. 
  One is not guilty of dogmatism even if one does regard such a scheme as true, 
  for one can see through it, so to speak -- see that it is only a mere set of 
  conceptual constructions and see that it points to what is really important. 
  It is the kind of thing to which it would be absurd to be attached, so one is 
  free to take it up or put it down according to circumstances. Buddhism has often 
  been described as antimetaphysical, but this is a serious oversimplification. 
  It all depends on what we have in mind by metaphysics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wittgenstein 
  was not antimetaphysical either, at least not in the way that it has often been 
  supposed. He has no project such as the elimination of metaphysics nor has he 
  any intention of reducing metaphysical propositions to nonsense. When doing 
  Wittgensteinian philosophy, metaphysical assertions are at first typically puzzling. 
  Then we are able to see that a feature of such propositions is that they obliterate 
  the distinction between empirical and conceptual inquiries. <A href="#5" name=[5]>[5]</A> They then take 
  on the aspect of nonsense. But at a deeper level of analysis we realize that 
  they are illuminating because they help to give us a clear view of the logical 
  or philosophical grammar of important terms in our language. It is because we 
  lack such a view that so many of our philosophical troubles arise. <A href="#6" name=[6]>[6]</A> The metaphysical 
  assertions remain quite undisturbed or unaltered for now we can see that they 
  are quite all right as they stand. Our angle of vision of them has changed. 
  This situation calls to mind a Zen master's characterization of what happens 
  in Zen practice. &quot;Before you study Zen, mountains are mountains and rivers 
  are rivers; while you are studying it, mountains are no longer mountains and 
  rivers are no longer rivers; but once you have Enlightenment, mountains are 
  once again mountains and rivers are rivers.&quot; <A href="#7" name=[7]>[7]</A> Despite the obvious difference 
  between the philosophical practice of</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">p. 474</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Wittgenstein and Zen meditation 
  there is an intriguing parallel between the steps taken to enlightenment or 
  understanding in each.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Wittgenstein 
  speaks of bringing metaphysical terms back to their uses in everyday language, 
  <A href="#8" name=[8]>[8]</A> he does not do so from any spirit of hostility to metaphysics but because 
  he wishes to show how they illuminate the deeper logical grammar of our language. 
  This consists of rules analogous to &quot;A sphere has no length&quot; or &quot;A 
  rod must have length,&quot; and rules of course are not descriptions. But with 
  metaphysical assertions we get what could be described as proposals to alter 
  some of the basic grammar. It is this which makes them illuminating and, even 
  at this deeper level of analysis, can give them a paradoxical look; although 
  once we can see what is going on they lose this. But as far as this kind of 
  view is concerned there is, to my knowledge, no parallel in Buddhist thought.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the view 
  that a feature of metaphysical propositions is that they obliterate the distinction 
  between conceptual and empirical inquiries, there may appear to be some agreement 
  but this is superficial and masks an important difference. The word 'empirical' 
  can be misleading here. What Wittgenstein has in mind by an empirical inquiry 
  would be regarded in Buddhism as merely another conceptual type. For Wittgenstein, 
  for instance, natural science would certainly count as an empirical inquiry, 
  but not for Buddhism, because it has an elaborate conceptual structure. Again, 
  Zen is often said to be concerned with direct, concrete experience. When we 
  speak of an experience in this way, we might think of direct perceptual experience 
  as a typical example, albeit this kind of experience is conceptualized; in Zen 
  we have to think in terms of nonconceptualized sensory experience. But this 
  kind of experience should not be thought of merely as nonconceptual. It is the 
  experience of one who is free from selfcenteredness and the attachments that 
  go with it. It is no use protesting that to do this is strictly impossible. 
  A whack with a master's stick or the first moment of pain after burning ourselves 
  on a hot stove will cut through our sophistries. So the demarcation between 
  the empirical and the conceptual is drawn along different lines from that taken 
  in Western philosophy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor is there 
  any analogy in Wittgenstein's work corresponding to the mistake which the Buddhists 
  think lies behind dogmatic metaphysics, that is, the confusion of transcendental 
  experience with ordinary experience. And while metaphysics may be illuminating 
  for each, it can hardly be said to be illuminating in the same way. Nevertheless, 
  despite this difference, there is an interesting parallel in the various steps 
  or stages of illumination and between the flexible attitudes toward metaphysics. 
  I suppose that the mistake mentioned has some analogy with the kind of mistake 
  which Gilbert Ryle called a &quot;category confusion&quot; or with what Wittgenstein 
  would describe as a confusion of</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">p. 475</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">the rules of different kinds of 
  language games. The Buddha seems to have laid down a basic rule for the conduct 
  of religious thinking. It is not so much that this rule is peculiar to Buddhism 
  but the way in which it is applied is a crucial factor in giving Buddhism its 
  distinctive character.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wittgenstein 
  does not try to restrict us to any one view of metaphysics. Like most other 
  assertions, metaphysical assertions are multifunctional. He has suggestions 
  about another way of looking at them. Our ordinary language &quot;holds our 
  minds in one position, as it were, and in this position sometimes it feels cramped, 
  having a desire for other positions as well.&quot; <A href="#9" name=[9]>[9]</A> A metaphysician invents 
  a notation which stresses a difference more strongly, makes it more obvious 
  than ordinary language does. In a way he has discovered &quot;a new way of looking 
  at things. As if [he] had invented a new way of painting, or again a new metre, 
  or a new kind of song.&quot; <A href="#10" name=[10]>[10]</A> According to this suggestion then, metaphysics 
  can be regarded as giving us the grammar so to speak, of a new way of thinking 
  which is involved in seeing the world differently and which frees us from a 
  kind of suffering -- from a sense of mental or spiritual cramp or constriction. 
  There can be, at the very most, only a very limited analogy between the kind 
  of suffering Wittgenstein and the Buddhists have in mind, and the notion of 
  word 'liberation' serves to conceal an important difference rather than to indicate 
  any significant similarity. For in Buddhism, liberation serves to fit us for 
  life in this everyday world by freeing us from its grip not to give us a vision 
  of a different world or even of this world seen in terms of different categories 
  and conceptual distinctions. Despite his suggestion, perhaps it is significant 
  that Wittgenstein himself in his work concentrated on the philosophical practice 
  of trying to free us from deep, personal puzzles and perplexities. But whether 
  this indicates a deeper resemblance requires separate and subsequent consideration.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buddhism has 
  been described as a set of methods and techniques rather than as a set of doctrines, 
  for even though it is customary to speak of &quot;doctrines,&quot; they are 
  only conceptual constructions and their test is their utility. Accordingly they 
  are best regarded methodologically rather than as statements of absolute and 
  fundamental truths. Wittgenstein too, denied that he taught any philosophical 
  theses or doctrines but only methods which function as kinds of therapy. For 
  philosophical perplexities are like different kinds of illness, and so different 
  methods are to be used according to the circumstances. Whether Buddhism and 
  Wittgenstein are or are not concerned basically with the same thing, their attitudes 
  toward dogmatism in philosophy are surprisingly similar. <A href="#11" name=[11]>[11]</A></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">p. 476</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of his 
  obvious interest in ordinary language and its connection with our perplexities, 
  a lot of people seem to think that Wittgenstein was mainly concerned with a 
  therapy of language. He is not concerned, however, with linguistic pathology 
  and some type of surgical reconstruction of language, but with people -- the 
  users of language -- and with some of the special features of the instrument 
  they use when they use language. These are the features which are of special 
  interest to philosophers, since lack of proper appreciation of them is an important 
  cause of our philosophical troubles. There is nothing wrong with natural language; 
  there is not even anything wrong with metaphysical language; the trouble lies 
  in us: in our lack of knowledge and insight into what we are doing when we use 
  language. Consequently he says: &quot;Philosophy may in no way interfere with 
  the actual use of language; it can in the end only describe it.&quot; <A href="#12" name=[12]>[12]</A> Of 
  course he did not mean that philosophy may not affect our own personal use of 
  language, for instance, by giving it greater clarity, but he did not see the 
  task of philosophy, as he wanted to do it, as the introduction of linguistic 
  reforms which substitute supposedly more precise and refined forms for ordinary 
  language. He wanted to help the users to reform themselves. This, of course, 
  is a far cry from the position of various contemporary purveyors of formal linguistic 
  programs and systems who are eagerly contributing their mite to the process 
  of fitting us for the dawning automated and computerized society.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a Zen point 
  of view there is nothing wrong with the forms of ordinary experience nor with 
  the forms of life which make up ordinary existence. There is not even anything 
  wrong with conceptual thinking and with metaphysics. The trouble lies in us. 
  There is no program of substituting some special supermundane experience for 
  ordinary experience nor some special type of holy life for ordinary everyday 
  life. But after the kind of insight which can occur in Zen practice, although 
  in a sense everything is left as it is, the person is different because his 
  angle of vision has changed. Ordinary experience is now the experience of a 
  bodhisattva and our ordinary life is the holy life. Here again, even though 
  one might say that Wittgenstein and the Zen Buddhists are obviously talking 
  about different things, there is an interesting similarity of attitude and approach 
  to them. In connection with this, Wittgenstein emphasized that language was 
  inescapably connected with life and with experience. &quot;... the speaking 
  of a language is part of an activity, or a form of life.&quot; <A href="#13" name=[13]>[13]</A> &quot;... 
  for is what is linguistic not an experience?&quot; <A href="#14" name=[14]>[14]</A></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wittgenstein 
  tells us that philosophical problems have depth: that &quot;they are deep disquietudes; 
  their roots are as deep in us as the forms of our language</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">p. 477</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">and their significance is as great 
  as the importance of our language.&quot; <A href="#15" name=[15]>[15]</A> I think that Zen Buddhists would 
  agree with the first statement and would also agree with Wittgenstein's characterization 
  of philosophy as a battle against the bewitchment of the intelligence by words, 
  but they would not regard the second statement as adequate. We want a heart 
  that is not bewitched, not merely an intelligence. The roots of our problems 
  are certainly deep, but the depth differs from that of our linguistic forms 
  and is proportional to the depth of our ego-centeredness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zen methods enable 
  us to reach down or out through thought and language, as normally used, to quite 
  a different level or kind of experience. Language can still be used here, of 
  course, but not as it is normally used in everyday life and science; for example, 
  as any reading of Zen literature quickly shows, and certainly not in a way appropriate 
  to a more linguistic type of therapy of the users of language in a philosophical 
  context. In order to help us reach out through thought and language and appreciate 
  the different type of task or problem with which we are faced, certain more 
  intellectual and philosophical moves are sometimes made as preliminary steps. 
  It is here that Fann's remark about the well-known ability of Zen masters to 
  show the nonsensical character of metaphysical questions and assertions applies. 
  The swift ironic and sometimes humorous demolition of such questions and assertions 
  serves to remind us that thinking of this type is out of place. The use of more 
  philosophical comments as reminders calls to mind one of Wittgenstein's characterizations 
  of philosophy as &quot;assembling reminders for a certain purpose.&quot; <A href="#16" name=[16]>[16]</A> 
  But although the general function is the same, the more special function is 
  different for philosophical comments are used to remind us of different things. 
  Wittgenstein keeps trying to bring us back from abstractions to what is concrete 
  and familiar, but which we are apt to overlook when we are doing philosophy; 
  and he keeps reminding us of these things and of what people do and do not merely 
  say in familiar everyday situations. This should not be taken to mean that he 
  gives what is familiar and everyday a special status at the expense of what 
  is unusual or strange but that he uses one to illuminate the other. Obviously 
  this cannot be done unless one can see what is before one's eyes or under one's 
  nose all the time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is a 
  severely practical form of Buddhism, Zen is par excellence meditational Buddhism. 
  In Rinzai Zen, as is well known, kooans are introduced into the meditation situation. 
  These kooans, among other things, can be regarded as functioning as reminders 
  or warnings that intellectual and logical types of thinking are out of place. 
  But whether kooans are introduced into the meditation situation or whether this 
  situation is itself regarded as a kooan, the</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">p. 478</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">effect at first is to generate deep 
  puzzlement and perplexity. For here the individual does not know his way about, 
  and even if he is given useful hints and admonitions he does not know how to 
  adjust to the situation. Nor is he told or shown, supposing that were possible: 
  this would defeat the entire point of the procedure. He must find his own way 
  himself. This makes Zen deeply personal in a very direct way. Recognition of 
  this adds another dimension to what we should understand by direct concrete 
  experience in Zen and adds another difference to what we would understand even 
  if we spoke of 'direct concrete personal experience'. This with all deference 
  to Wittgenstein who also thought that philosophy was deeply personal and not 
  something formal, neutral, and detached.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the person 
  does not know his way about in the kooan cum meditation situation, the situation 
  seems to have the typical form of one which can be cleared up by intelligent 
  inquiry, experimentation, and reflection. Despite warnings and reminders he 
  will tend to treat it as if it were a situation of this kind and become more 
  puzzled and perplexed than ever. He displays a tendency to force all problem 
  situations into the same general mold, thus showing how his thinking is nourished 
  by one-sided examples, which Wittgenstein remarks is a main cause of philosophical 
  disease; a statement with which any Zen master could agree. A crucial step is 
  made when the person sees, not merely intellectually but deeply feels, that 
  his rigid and stereotyped approach is not correct. It is a very intelligent 
  kind of insight. Rather too much by way of overcorrection of prevalent tendencies 
  is apt to be made of the so-called non-rationality of Zen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deep puzzlement 
  and frustration generated in this situation has an analog in Wittgenstein's 
  procedure with his students. He did his utmost to ensure that they were thoroughly 
  perplexed by a philosophical problem. They had to actually feel and live it 
  and work their way into and through it. A person has to feel the need of the 
  clarification, which a comment or observation on a philosophical problem may 
  bring, otherwise it is worth very little. He does not give us any so-called 
  answers, but only methods and suggestions to be used according to the circumstances; 
  nor does he explain to us how to use his methods, although he gives us examples 
  to illustrate their point, which we have to see for ourselves. Again, he believed 
  that a question is often best disposed of by a question; to give an answer is 
  often unfair for it is apt to involve one-sidedness and in any case is too apt 
  to close up further inquiries. Sometimes he disposes of a question or a thesis 
  by a joke. He once even suggested that a perfectly serious philosophical work 
  could be written which consisted entirely of jokes or of questions. The similarity 
  in the type of procedure used to that used by a Zen master is too obvious to 
  require further comment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Wittgenstein 
  has no intention of trying to tie us to philosophy. On the contrary, by freeing 
  us from philosophical perplexities he aims to free us</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">p. 479</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">from philosophy; for the discovery 
  which really counts is the one that makes one capable of not philosophizing 
  when one wants. It is hardly surprising that various professional philosophers 
  should regard such a standpoint with amused incredulity and scepticism. In Buddhism 
  too the aim, among other things, is to free us from the grip of doctrines and 
  teachings, even Buddhist ones: for these are merely like rafts, which enable 
  us to cross a river. When we have crossed we have no further use for them. Here 
  again, whatever we may say about the similarity or lack of it between the final 
  goal of peace and clarity for which Wittgenstein was striving and the goal of 
  Zen, one can hardly deny a similarity in attitude to theses and doctrines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wittgenstein 
  saw philosophical problems, not as interesting, intellectual puzzles but as 
  deeply personal and genuinely tormenting, and for him the practice of philosophy 
  was a way of life for freeing us from them. He speaks of the peace that comes 
  from the real philosophical discovery, &quot;the ... discovery which makes me 
  capable of stopping doing philosophy when I want to.&quot; <A href="#17" name=[17]>[17]</A> So for him, 
  philosophy can be regarded as a way of liberation from obsessive worries and 
  perplexities that have a central role in our lives and find their expression 
  in philosophical problems. The culminating question of whether there is any 
  analogy between 'the real philosophical discovery' of which he speaks and the 
  serenity and clarity and the ability to 'take up and put down' theses, attitudes, 
  and feelings as they come and go, without agitation or disturbance, which are 
  products of Zen meditation and training, must now be faced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough has been 
  said, I think, to show that to maintain there is no similarity between Zen and 
  the philosophical practice of Wittgenstein, is untenable. But although the similarities 
  mentioned may be interesting and surprising, and depending on our point of view 
  and approach, even important, it does not follow that they warrant any claim 
  of a similarity such as the one in question. Perhaps what they take to be the 
  absence of this similarity is what some people have in mind when they say there 
  is no real resemblance. I will now attempt to put forward some considerations 
  which support this claim.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all is said 
  and done Buddhist philosophy and Zen practice are based on a faith which understandably 
  finds no expression in Wittgenstein's position. Naagaarjuna, for example, may 
  indeed have been a great critical and dialectical philosopher in his own right, 
  but he was a deeply religious man and his philosophy is carried out from this 
  position and can be properly understood only in terms of it. Again, it is doubtful, 
  to say the least, whether Zen has anything even approaching the same view of 
  the dispersal of doubt and perplexity that Wittgenstein has. In Rinzai Zen for 
  instance, one does not try to clear up and resolve doubts and worries about 
  the meaning of life, the world, and so on, by</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">p. 480</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">linguistic analysis or any other 
  kind of analysis. One simply doubts and doubts until, as it has been said, one 
  becomes one with the doubt. Indeed it is doubtful whether &quot;doubt&quot; 
  is even quite the right word, for there is wonder and faith involved as well. 
  Wittgenstein's procedure with his students is certainly surprisingly like that 
  of a Zen master with his pupils. But their aim is different. The former wants 
  to get his students to feel the doubt for themselves as a preliminary to exploring 
  and probing it. The latter wants to help his pupils to dispose of anything that 
  will distract them from just letting their doubt alone and becoming one with 
  it. This, of course, applies, among other things, to the demonstrations of the 
  absurdity of metaphysical types of questions and assertions. In other words 
  he uses his supporting procedures to discourage the very kind of activities 
  that Wittgenstein uses his to encourage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be said 
  that understandably there is no analog in Wittgenstein's philosophy for meditation, 
  which is central and crucial in Zen and in Buddhism generally; accordingly there 
  can be no place for the techniques appropriate to meditation in the practice 
  of his philosophy. This, of course, is true but the difference goes deeper than 
  that. It has to do with the different diagnoses of spiritual disorder, provided 
  one is prepared to describe the puzzlement and perplexity with which Wittgenstein 
  was so afflicted. For whereas he seems to ascribe it to our lack of a clear 
  view of the logical grammar of our discourse and uses the knowledge of this 
  gained by philosophy to make the distinctions which help to release us from 
  our worries, in Zen we come to see how ego-centeredness and attachment lead 
  us to make distinctions and keep things apart when really they are together 
  all the time. If one says that both agree in regarding ignorance as a crucial 
  source of our troubles, then it seems clear enough that each understands the 
  term differently. Again, Wittgenstein is much more concerned with therapy than 
  with the style of life which follows successful therapy. One gets the impression 
  that he regarded the kind of enlightenment he sought as marking the end of crucial 
  philosophical practice for a person, though he may, of course deepen and extend 
  his understanding and try to help others by acquainting them with his skills 
  and techniques. So far as Zen is concerned, there is an unfortunate and rather 
  prevalent misconception that enlightenment or satori is the end and culmination 
  of Zen practice; whereas it is the beginning of it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For both Wittgenstein 
  and Zen, enlightenment is thought of in terms of changing the angle of vision 
  to what is natural or what is given rather than of replacing them with something 
  else or of directing our attention elsewhere. Because the forms of nature, of 
  life, and of language are all right as they stand, the source of our difficulties 
  lies in ourselves. Wittgenstein likens philosophy to a therapy of the users 
  of language rather than of language itself; there are different methods like 
  different therapies and they should be used according to the circumstances. 
  He refuses to tie us down to any one method and has no</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">p. 481</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">philosophical theses to propound. 
  He is constantly trying to free us from the bewitchment of words and concepts 
  and ignorance of what we are doing when we use language -- all of which lead 
  to rigidity and dogmatism and one-sided emphases and theses. This instrumental 
  approach and the attempt to free us from rigidity and dogmatism has obvious 
  resemblances to what are regarded as the results of Zen practice. The enlightenment 
  conferred by both Wittgensteinian and Zen practice is a kind of emancipation 
  or freedom. For Wittgenstein it is the kind of emancipation which makes one 
  capable of not philosophizing when one wants, of taking it up or putting it 
  down. Above all it means freedom from the obsessive worries and perplexities 
  which played a central role in his life. It might be said that any resemblance 
  between the freedom attainable by Wittgensteinian and Zen methods can, at most, 
  be only partial. But I think the position is that if a person did happen to 
  attain Wittgensteinian freedom one could not guarantee that he would be free 
  from such worries as those about death, the way he is treated by others, and 
  the like; whereas if he genuinely attained the freedom sought by Zen one should 
  be able to guarantee this. In other words one cannot assert that the Wittgensteinian 
  would not be free from such worries but only that one could not guarantee it. 
  Finally regarding procedure, there are certainly striking resemblances between 
  Wittgenstein's practice of &quot;assembling reminders for a certain purpose&quot; 
  and his procedure with his students, and certain aspects of Zen practice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To dismiss the 
  differences and resemblances mentioned as superficial and unimportant does not 
  seem to me to be reasonable, but this means that any attempt to assess the claim 
  that Wittgenstein was striving for the same goal as that sought by Zen is not 
  a simple and straightforward matter. The differences are such that they cannot 
  be said to be seeking the same identical goal. On the other hand, the resemblances 
  are good enough to make it unreasonable to assert that they are completely different. 
  In view of this I think we can conclude that there is a resemblance between 
  the goal of Wittgenstein and that of Zen, and by saying this I mean that the 
  resemblance is of a significant and not merely of a superficial kind. To go 
  further than this does not seem possible because any argument for drawing them 
  closer together can be countered by good arguments for keeping them further 
  apart and vice versa. When it is claimed that the two goals have a likeness 
  or resemblance it is natural to want some more definite statement and to ask: 
  &quot;How alike and how unlike are they?&quot; But such a question gives rise 
  to other difficult and complex ones, which it would be out of place to try to 
  answer here; for example, What are the criteria to be employed in reaching a 
  decision and what kind of person is best qualified to act as judge or assessor 
  in such a matter? Indeed, has such a question any answer at all or in what sense 
  if any has it one?</font></p>
